My game is titled Flappy Fish and is an underwater themed obstacle game inspired by Flappy Bird. You play as a fish navigating through a seaweed forest whilst trying to escape the jaws of a hungry shark. The player chooses from 4 different fish characters and presses the spacebar to "swim" upwards to avoid collisions with the seaweed. There are starfish randomly interspersed throughout the levels, and when 20 are collected, an additional life is given. If the player has a life left and collides with the seaweed, they can continue playing. If a player has no lives and collides with the seaweed, they become stuck, and the shark catches up to them. 

A point is granted after a column of seaweed is passed. At 15 points, the player moves on to level 2. Then, the number of points needed to reach the next level doubles. For example, 30 points are needed for level 3, 60 points for level 4, and so on. After every level, the speed increases and the gap between the seaweed lessens to enhance the difficulty. The game loop involves gravity and jump physics to control the vertical fish movement. Seaweed columns are spawned randomly and scroll from right to left across the screen. Collision detection handles the interactions between the fish, seaweed, starfish, and shark. The game also includes multiple menu systems, e.g., title screen, character selection, instructions, game over, and level-up. The starfish are animated using 4 different individual frames, and sound effects/ background music are integrated throughout the game.

My game is titled Flappy Fish and is an ocean-themed flappy bird style game. Players choose from 4 different fish avatars and swim through the ocean while trying to avoid the seaweed obstacles. The objective is simply to survive as long as possible, and points are awarded based on how many columns of seaweed have been passed.
The fish is constantly pulled down by gravity and the randomly generated seaweed continuously scrolls from right to left. The player presses the spacebar to make the fish swim upwards to avoid the obstacles. When the player collides with the seaweed or swims off the screen, it is considered a loss, and there is an option to restart or quit the game.
I plan to add levels to the game that increase in difficulty by increasing the speed of the seaweed. I am having some difficulty with the seaweed placement, which I need to fix (you can see in the demo that sometimes the seaweed will spawn too far out). Also, I  need to adjust the collision box so it is less sensitive.
