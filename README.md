My game is titled Flappy Fish and is an ocean-themed flappy bird style game. Players choose from 4 different fish avatars and swim through the ocean while trying to avoid the seaweed obstacles. The objective is simply to survive as long as possible, and points are awarded based on how many columns of seaweed have been passed.

The fish is constantly pulled down by gravity and the randomly generated seaweed continuously scrolls from right to left. The player presses the spacebar to make the fish swim upwards to avoid the obstacles. When the player collides with the seaweed or swims off the screen, it is considered a loss, and there is an option to restart or quit the game.

I plan to add levels to the game that increase in difficulty by increasing the speed of the seaweed. I am having some difficulty with the seaweed placement, which I need to fix (you can see in the demo that sometimes the seaweed will spawn too far out). Also, I  need to adjust the collision box so it is less sensitive.
